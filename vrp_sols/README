This directory contains the best solutions that I discovered for 
the larger VRP instances.  This was done using a parallel algorithm
combining the RTR metaheuristic with a set partitioning/covering
formulation that I solved using CPLEX.  These computations used up
to 128 processors, and none of the serial algorithms currently included
with VRPH are powerful enough to produce many of these solutions.

Solutions are given as a space-delimited list.  First element in the
list is the # of nodes in the problem.  The remaining elements in the
list give the order in which the nodes are visited, and a negative index
indicates the beginning of a new route.

For example:

6 -2 3 -1 -4 5 6 0 

represents the routes

0-2-3-0
0-1-0
0-4-5-6-0
